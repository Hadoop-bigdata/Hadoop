Hadoop Filesystem has its own web for user to manage their file. In order to take the benefit of web management, we will set up this environment.

1. Update apt-get
	Due to the Hadoop image is out of date, we need to do some update before setting up the environment.
	
	#apt-get update
 
2. Install vim
	Vim is the editor for Linux System. 
	In the project, we need vim to edit the codes.
	
	#apt-get install vim
 
3. Set up Web HDFS management environment
	vi is the command for Linux system to create new file to edit the code
	
	#cd /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/
 
	#vi core-site.xml
	
	‘’’
	type i to insert the command
	add the command at the bottom of the core-site.xml file
	type command : and the type wq save the file and quit the vim file.
	‘’’
	
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<configuration>
    		<property>
        		<name>fs.defaultFS</name>
        		<value>hdfs://hadoop-master:9000/</value>
    		</property>
